Description: rhinno is an experimentdata package containing Keras-based neural network models for the analysis of single-cell T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor sequences. The package is compatible with the scRepertoire ecosystem and includes models for generating latent dimensional space for single-cell repertoires and individual sequences. The latter models for sequence-level vectorization are used in the Ibex and Trex packages.
